System Security Checker is a bundle of small shell scripts to test your computer
security (released under AGPL).

All scripts run in read-only mode and will never modify any file on your system.
They rather print actions that should be done to improve system security.
You always have the last word (see Disclaimer bellow).

Test scripts come from various sources:
  - Common Configuration Enumeration (CCEâ„¢)
    all files named CCE-<ID>.sh (<ID> is the official CCE's ID)
    <https://cce.mitre.org/lists/cce_list.html>

  - Guide to the Secure Configuration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
    all files named NSA-<ID>.sh (<ID> is the section number in the PDF bellow)
    <https://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/os/redhat/rhel5-guide-i731.pdf>

  - other common best practices from here and there (custom tests)
    all files named SSC-<ID>.sh (<ID> is an incremental counter)

WARNING: This is a beta release still under development!

The primarily targeted OS are Fedora, CentOS & Debian.
Other distributions might have fewer tests.
Since CentOS is fully compatible, RHEL should be too (not tested though).
Tests should be applicable to all variants (Desktop & Server) of each OS.

# Clone the latest version of SSC.
git clone https://github.com/infertux/sysechk.git
cd sysechk

# Or if you have already cloned it before, update it.
cd sysechk
git pull

# Now, check if your system has all required tools (sed, grep, awk, etc.).
# It will print only "Done." if all dependencies are satisfied.
./tools/check_env.sh

# Finally, run all tests (it may take a while).
./run_tests.sh

# You can also run each test individually.

Writing test scripts is probably the most boring part of this application but
it is also a challenging one to write quick and pretty shell scripts.
Every script does one test but does it well (UNIX way ;)).

I am not a Bash guru! There are probably bugs or optimizations that can be done
in test scripts. Any patches are welcome! :)
